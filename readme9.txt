This is not a tutorial. There are my codes created for the request below:


Create a basic webpage that will include three separate user input areas, each with their own button for processing.  When each input areas button is clicked, the output will go to an on page output area specific to that input. You will have three input areas with buttons and three output areas.

Each input/output combination will perform a different task:

    Will take the user input from a single entry field of a validated date in mm/dd/yyyy format.  You only need to validate the date format, not that it is a valid date. The associated output area will display the current date in mm/dd/yyyy format, the date that was input and the number of days between the two dates. Be sure to indicate which date was input and which is the current date.
    Will take a validated number from 10-99 from a single entry field.  The associated output area will display a random whole number from 10 to a maximum of the number input.
    Will take input from two text fields. The associated output area will display the content of both input fields and an indication if the input from field one is a substring of the input from field two.

Each output area is allowed to overwrite previous results if the associated input area is used more than once.  Provide output to each area in any way you prefer.
